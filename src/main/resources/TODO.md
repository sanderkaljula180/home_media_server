For completing 5 sprints in one week, we need to adjust the plan to be more focused and realistic. Here's a streamlined version that's achievable in 5 days (one sprint per day):

### Sprint 1 (Day 1) - Core Testing
```markdown
□ Essential Test Coverage Only
   [x] Complete AuthServiceTest (3 missing test cases) - 1 hour
   □ Create UserFactoryTest (core functionality) - 1 hour
   □ Basic Integration Test for Auth flow - 2 hours
□ JaCoCo Setup
   □ Add to pom.xml - 30 mins
   □ Configure basic rules - 30 mins
```


### Sprint 2 (Day 2) - Basic Infrastructure
```markdown
□ Error Handling
   □ Global exception handler - 2 hours
   □ Basic structured logging - 1 hour
□ API Documentation
   □ OpenAPI/Swagger setup - 1 hour
   □ Document existing endpoints - 2 hours
```


### Sprint 3 (Day 3) - Lists & Favorites MVP
```markdown
□ Core Implementation
   □ UserList & Favorites entities - 1 hour
   □ Basic repository layer - 1 hour
   □ Service layer with basic tests - 2 hours
   □ REST endpoints - 2 hours
```

### Sprint 4 ### Video Streaming Enhancement & Progress
```markdown
□ Morning (4 hours):
Video Streaming Improvements
□ Add adaptive bitrate streaming (2 hours)
- Multiple quality options
- Bandwidth detection
□ Enhance error handling (1 hour)
- Better file not found handling
- Stream corruption protection
□ Add basic caching (1 hour)
- Cache frequently accessed chunks

□ Afternoon (4 hours):
Progress Tracking
□ WatchProgress implementation (2 hours)
□ Basic resume functionality (2 hours)
```


### Sprint 5 (Day 5) - Security & Performance
```markdown
□ Essential Enhancements
   □ Basic rate limiting - 2 hours
   □ JWT token enhancement - 2 hours
   □ Simple caching implementation - 2 hours
```


Key Points for Success:
1. Focus on MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for each feature
2. Skip nice-to-have features
3. Write minimal but essential tests
4. Use Spring Boot's built-in capabilities where possible
5. Keep implementations simple and extendable

Would you like to:
1. Start with Sprint 1 right away?
2. Review any specific sprint in detail?
3. Adjust the timeline or scope?

This is an aggressive schedule but doable if we:
- Keep implementations simple
- Focus on core functionality
- Make careful trade-offs between features and time
- Use Spring Boot's auto-configuration where possible
